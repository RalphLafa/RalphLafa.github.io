# Central problem of linear algebra

## Basic Concepts

The central problem of linear algebra is to solve ***linear equations***

We have n equations in n unknowns. \
For simplicity of case, let's assume n = 2

$ 
\begin{align}
\nonumber 1x + 2y =3 \\ \nonumber 4x + 5y = 6
\end{align}
$

There are two methods to solve this system.

**1. Elimination**\
**2. Determinants**

</font>

 For elimination, we can just multiply certain number to equation 2 to remove one of unknowns and then, proceed **Back-substitution** \
 To apply to given example, 

$
  \begin{align}
  \nonumber (equation \, 2) -\, 4(equation 1) \quad\cdots\cdots \quad -3y = -6
  \end{align}
$
