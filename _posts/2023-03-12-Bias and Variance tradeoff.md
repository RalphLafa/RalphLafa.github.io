## Tradeoff
<br />
<br />
<br />

### Underfiiting(High bias)
 If a model has high bias, it means that the training data set is not sufficient. \
 The gap between training data and test data is so large that the trained model couldn't fit to test data.It also means that the model doesn't even represent the trained data

<br />
<br />

### Overfitting(High Variance)
 If the model is overfitted, bias can be low. However, the model is only fitted to train data and the error of test data is huge. We can say, for this case, that it has high variance.

## To prevent Overfitting

 1. Reduce Features using model selection algorithm
 2. Regularization
